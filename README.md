# Reimbursement Management Systems

## Overview

This is a management tool for employee's and managers to request, approve and decline reimbursement requests through a simple interface. Employee's can submit their reimbursement requests with a dollar amount and description. These requests can also be viewed after submission and canceled. Managers have the same features as employees but they also have the option to decline and accept requests of employees or other managers. Managers are unable to change the status of their own requests.
